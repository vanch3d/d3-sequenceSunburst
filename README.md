# d3-sequenceSunburst

A d3-module (v4) refactoring of the sequence sunburst originally from [@kerryrodden](https://github.com/kerryrodden)

It shows how it is possible to use a D3 sunburst visualization (partition layout) with data that describes sequences of events.

The original source code for the graph can be found [here](https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/766f8f6d31f645c39f488a0befa1e3c8) 
for d3v4 and [here](https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426) for d3v3.

> TODO

The module has been created on the basis of Mike Bostock's [guidelines](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/d3-plugin/).
